Overview
The Virtual Interview Platform is a web-based application built with PHP that streamlines the recruitment process. It allows recruiters to upload job postings and add fundamental questions related to the position. Job seekers can apply for these jobs by attending an online exam. If they pass the exam, they proceed to a face-to-face interview, making the hiring process more efficient and focused.

Features

Online Exam: Job seekers can take an online exam as part of the application process. This helps to filter out candidates who meet the basic qualifications.
Automated Screening: The platform automatically evaluates the exam results and notifies the recruiter of qualified candidates.
Face-to-Face Interview Scheduling: Candidates who pass the exam are invited to schedule a face-to-face interview.
